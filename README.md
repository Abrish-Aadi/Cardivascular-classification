# Cardiovascular Outlier Handling and Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on outlier handling and classification of a cardiovascular disease dataset. The notebook utilizes the dataset available on Kaggle, which provides information about various attributes related to cardiovascular health.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). The dataset includes features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other relevant attributes, along with the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `Cardiovascular_Outlier_Handling_Classification.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for handling outliers and performing classification tasks on the cardiovascular disease dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, outlier detection and handling, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section focuses on loading the cardiovascular disease dataset, examining its structure, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and data type conversions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, the dataset is explored through visualizations and statistical analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify potential outliers, and understand the relationships between different variables.

3. Outlier Handling: Here, outliers in the dataset are detected using appropriate techniques, and strategies for handling outliers are implemented. This may include removing outliers, replacing them with appropriate values, or transforming the data.

4. Feature Engineering: Additional features are created or existing features are transformed to enhance the predictive power of the classification models. This may involve feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, or generating new derived features.

5. Model Building: In this section, various classification models are trained using the preprocessed dataset. Models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or gradient boosting can be explored.

6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess their performance in predicting cardiovascular disease.

7. Conclusion: The concluding remarks provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting the key findings and insights gained from handling outliers and performing classification tasks on the cardiovascular disease dataset.
